The transition to renewable energy is a pressing issue facing the world. The UK has committed to being carbon neutral by 2050, which will require huge changes in our infrastructure, particularly energy generation and storage.

Each country faces this issue and is using different types of renewables according to its unique geography. For example, Iceland and Kenya are powered mostly by geothermal energy, whilst Morocco and Germany are investing heavily in solar photovoltaic cells (PVC) [1].

Using publicly available data from the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change, I want to answer the following questions.

1. By how much has the UK's renewable energy capacity increased over the last 20 years?
2. Where and in what technologies has this growth been concentrated?

The dataset contains the details of every renewable energy project proposed since 2001, including geographical (X/Y coordinates, postcode, region, country), technical (technology type, specifics for some eg number of wind turbines), and the timeline of each project (date of proposal, date and outcome of planning permission decision, date construction began, current status).

NOTE: since I did this project, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has implemented an API which does the same thing, but much better. I'm not bitter. https://data.barbour-abi.com/smart-map/repd/beis/?type=repd
